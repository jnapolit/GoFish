#CREATOR: Jessica Napolitano
#FUNCTION: This class creates a Deck which is just a list of playing cards.
#This class utalizes the PlayingCard class. It includes the methods of: shuffle
#which randomizes all the playing cards in the list, dealCard which pops the first
#card off the deck and returns it, and cardsLeft which returns the number of playing
#cards left in the deck.
